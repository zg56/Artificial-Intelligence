For these projects the game engines were provided by our Professor thus I have no rights to upload the full code.
I was merely responsible to write an appropiate artificial intelligence to play the given game.
In lack of source code, a link is provided to each programs that demonstrate how the algorithm works in each case.

Game 1:
Implemented an A* algorithm for a strategic game. The video follows how the computer is playing the game.
Some parts of the code is also displayed in this video. The program is implemented in JAVA.

Game 3:
Implemented Kruskals algorithm to generate the map content for the provided game engine. The video shows
how the algorithm creates the map files readed by the game engine. Implemented in JAVA.
